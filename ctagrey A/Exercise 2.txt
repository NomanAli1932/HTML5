Exercise 2 — resources.html
• Use <!DOCTYPE html> and set <html lang>.
• Include <head> with the same document/metadata tags as Exercise 1.
• Choose a different <title> and <meta name="description">.
• Reuse the same <base> as Exercise 1.
• In <body>: list three relative resource links ('slides.html', 'lab1.html', 'reference.html') so they resolve via 
<base>.
• Add a line with UTF-8 characters or emojis to verify encoding.
